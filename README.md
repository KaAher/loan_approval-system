The Loan Approval Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict loan approval status. It uses a trained ML model to analyze input data such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and other factors. The system:  
- Accepts input data through a user-friendly interface created using **Streamlit**.  
- Stores input data and predictions securely in a **MySQL database** using **XAMPP**.  
- Displays prediction results without exposing stored data on the app screen.  
- Ensures a sleek design, with features like black headers and a clean interface.
